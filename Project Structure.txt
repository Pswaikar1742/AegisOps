    🧱 Who Owns What File? (Strict Assignments)

1. Dev 1 (P - The Brain):

    You own aegis_core/.

    Crucial: You also own docker_ops.py. Why? Because your Agent is the one that decides to restart the container. Your code needs the docker library.

2. Dev 2 (A - The Hands/Infra):

    You own aegis_infra/.

    Crucial: You are building the Victim. Your app exists only to die. You also own the docker-compose.yml in the root (since you are the systems guy) to make sure all 3 folders spin up together.

3. Dev 3 (S - The Face):

    You own aegis_dashboard/.

    Crucial: You are isolated. You just consume APIs.
